  A compilation of components for your README.md
</p>

## How to use
Only copy and paste the code of the component you want to use in your README.md file. Then, you can change the usermane value for your GutHub's username.

Is really easy to use, isn't it?

Change the <code>?usermane=</code> value for your GitHub's username.

**Remember:** You can delete the brackets [USERNAME] in the URL for that it works.
