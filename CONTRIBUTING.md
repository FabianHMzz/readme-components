- If you have added or modified any files, you must add them to the list of modified files.
    - After adding the files, you should perform a commit with the message describing the change made.
    - After committing, you should push to the <code>pre-build</code> branch.
    - After performing the push, you must create a new pull request.

### Aditional Info âš 

If you want to add a new component so that it is reflected on the website, you must enter the folder ðŸ‘‰ ** [data] (https://github.com/fabianhmzz/readme-components/tree/main/data)* * ðŸ‘ˆ and check what type of component is, if it is dynamic or static. After having confirmed what type of component is it seeks the `.json` corresponding to the component.
 
  In each folder he finds an `readme.md` file with a table to know what each abbreviation means and thus find the `.json` of the component you want to add.
